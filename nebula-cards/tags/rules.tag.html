    <h3>Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Every turn a player or NPC can attack another player or NPC at the same planet. The attacker chooses an Item to attack with. The defender's Shield tokens block the same number of Hull damage. The remaining Hull damage subtract from the defenders Hull. Then the Item's Shield damage subtract from the defenders Shield tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attack with (Hull:-2, Shield:-1) on a defender with (Hull:5, Shield:1) will leave the defender with (Hull:4, Shield:0).
